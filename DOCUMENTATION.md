# Genesis Documentation

## Introduction

Genesis is a full-stack AI-powered platform for building decentralized applications (dApps). It combines multiple AI agents, MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, and the NullShot framework to generate complete Web3 projects.

## Quick Start

### 1. Sign Up
Create an account at [Genesis](/) to get started with 100 free credits.

### 2. Create a Project
Click "New Project" in the dashboard to start a new dApp session.

### 3. Describe Your dApp
Tell Genesis what you want to build:
- "Create an ERC20 token with vesting"
- "Build an NFT marketplace"
- "Make a DAO with voting"

### 4. Review the Plan
Genesis will generate a detailed plan. Review and approve it.

### 5. Build
Genesis will generate:
- Smart contracts (Solidity)
- Frontend (React/Next.js)
- Backend APIs (if needed)
- Configuration files
- Documentation

### 6. Export & Deploy
Download your project as a ZIP and deploy to your preferred platform.

## MCP Servers

Genesis provides MCP-compatible servers that can be used with any AI agent.

### Available Tools

#### 1. `analyze_security`
Analyzes smart contract code for security vulnerabilities.

**Input:**
```json
{
  "source_code": "pragma solidity ^0.8.0; contract Token { ... }"
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "high",
      "title": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
      "description": "..."
    }
  ],
  "score": 85
}
```

#### 2. `verify_source`
Generates Etherscan verification URL for a contract.

**Input:**
```json
{
  "address": "0x..."
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "verification_url": "https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x...#code"
}
```

#### 3. `deploy_contract`
Provides deployment guidance (actual deployment via dashboard).

### Using MCP with Your Agent

```typescript
// Connect to Genesis MCP Server
const mcpClient = new MCPClient('https://genesis-ai.genesis-ai.workers.dev');

// List available tools
const tools = await mcpClient.listTools();

// Call a tool
const result = await mcpClient.callTool('analyze_security', {
  source_code: contractCode
});
```

### Testing MCP
Visit [/mcp-test](/mcp-test) to test the MCP server live.

## AI Agents

Genesis uses multiple specialized AI agents:

### 1. Architect Agent
**Role:** Plans the dApp architecture

**Capabilities:**
- Analyzes requirements
- Designs system architecture
- Creates project structure
- Recommends best practices

**Example:**
```
User: "Build a token with staking"
Architect: "I'll create:
1. ERC20 token contract
2. Staking contract with rewards
3. Frontend for staking UI
4. Admin dashboard
..."
```

### 2. Engineer Agent
**Role:** Writes the code

**Capabilities:**
- Generates smart contracts
- Creates frontend components
- Writes backend APIs
- Implements integrations

**Example:**
```solidity
// Generated by Engineer Agent
contract StakingRewards {
    IERC20 public stakingToken;
    mapping(address => uint256) public stakes;
    // ... complete implementation
}
```

### 3. Security Analyst Agent
**Role:** Ensures code security

**Capabilities:**
- Scans for vulnerabilities
- Checks for common exploits
- Recommends security improvements
- Validates access controls

**Findings:**
- Reentrancy risks
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Access control issues
- Gas optimization opportunities

### 4. Optimizer Agent
**Role:** Improves performance

**Capabilities:**
- Optimizes gas usage
- Improves code efficiency
- Reduces deployment costs
- Enhances user experience

## NullShot Framework

Genesis is built on the NullShot framework, enabling:

### 1. Zero-Shot Learning
AI agents can handle new tasks without specific training.

### 2. Multi-Agent Collaboration
Agents work together seamlessly:
```
Architect → Engineer → Security → Optimizer
```

### 3. Streaming Responses
Real-time updates as code is generated.

### 4. Context Awareness
Agents remember conversation history and project context.

### 5. Tool Integration
Agents can use external tools (MCP servers, web search, etc.).

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
Instead of: "Make a token"
Try: "Create an ERC20 token with 1M supply, 18 decimals, and transfer fees"

### 2. Review Plans
Always review the AI's plan before approving. Make changes if needed.

### 3. Test Thoroughly
Test generated contracts on testnets before mainnet deployment.

### 4. Use Security Analysis
Always run security analysis on generated contracts.

### 5. Manage Credits
Monitor your credit usage. Add more when needed.
